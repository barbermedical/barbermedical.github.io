      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a junior doctor from Cork, Ireland. 
        I graduated from University College Cork School of Medicine in 2022. I currently work in anaesthetics &amp; intensive care in Melbourne, Australia. 
        I wrote extensive notes for my own final medical exams, and these are freely available for download. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I aim to train in anaesthesia and expand my involvement in medical education.

          <p>
            I have been involved in education since starting my medical degree with tutoring, class delivery,
             and material and assessment design. I have completed a master's degree in medical education based on
             research in medical student admissions. My medical student notes have been freely available for use
             since my own graduation.
